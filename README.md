# color-extractor

This tool generates dynamic colors from images using a simple k-Means algorithm. It's specifically designed for engineers who may not have a strong sense for color, but would like to dynamically adapt their designs based on existing images. Feel free to use this tool to design themes for various platforms, including web, desktop, and Android.

A sample deployed website can be found [here](https://www.remisiki.com/apps/colorex). All code runs in the browser, no image size limitations and by default 5 colors are returned.
